# Littleton Streets Manifesto: Safe and convenient streets can transform our community. We should start with our education corridors. 

### Manifesto

Many of you have heard about Martin Luther. In Germany in 1517 Luther posted a list of 95 theses(?) on the door of the local Catholic church protesting against many practices he found to be harmful and that prevented his people from living a better life. I am not Martin Luther, but this is my manifesto about our streets in Littleton and the rest of the United States, and why I believe we are doing some downright harmful things, and how I think we can transform our city. 

### We have a large problem

In Littleton Colorado, and all over the United States, our policies, budgets, and priorities endanger our most vulnerable, waste our resources, and do not take full opportunity of the potential we have to make a wonderful place to work, live, visit, and share moments with those we love. Our streets are _almost_ completely prioritized for the safety, convenience, and usage of cars. We have left no space for bicycles and pedestrians. Cars have been prioritized so much that the existence of other transportation opportunities have been made non-viable. We are going to dive into the issue, some potential hurdles to solve this problem, and then focus on an immediate term first step to solving this problem. 

### But first, gratitude

But first, a moment of gratitude. Littleton has some terrible bicycle infrastructure, but it also has some wonderful bicycle infrastructure. Visionaries in Littleton decades ago prioritized the creation of walking and bicycling paths throughout our fair city. The Highland Canal, the different Gulch trails, the South Platte River trail and many others create a wonderful web of nature paths and bicycles paths throughout our city. It’s not all bad! But we are focused today on how it can be so much better! 

### Tradeoffs

Politicians usually ignore the tradeoffs that must be made and focus solely on the one thing they believe their constituents want. How do we make policies for a diverse group of people who do not want the same outcomes? Politicians so rarely acknowledge this dynamic. I want to tackle it head on. I want to start by saying there are no perfect solutions. We only get to choose between different tradeoffs. I am going to repeat that. There are no solutions without flaw, there are only tradeoffs. The tradeoffs and compromises we choose say so much about our values and our priorities. We must acknowledge the tradeoff of a reduction of convenience for some modes of transportation in order for the other modes of transportation to exist and thrive. Our roads are not a zero sum game. Improvements for bikes CAN AND DO make things better for cars. But we would be delusional if we did not confront the fact that we need to make policies that represent compromise. A foundational viewpoint of this video is that there are a few foundational principles we should factor in when making these choices. To me, they are: 

  - Safety: This must be our top priority. Should we create systems that are so safe nobody ever dies at any financial cost? I don’t think so. But the degree we do to make our cities safe is a worthwhile debate. I don’t believe we are finding the right balance now with safety. Too many people are dying, and especially children. Safety should be our top priority and the primary lens through which we view and prioritize our policies for transportation.
  - Environment: We get one earth. So far, we have no alternative planet we can escape to. We must prioritize the policies and modes of transportation that best protect the earth, reduce pollution and our warming climate, and conserve the most of our earth’s resources.
  - Accessibility: There are some people who cannot ride bicycles or walk. There are some people who cannot drive. There are many people who cannot afford a car. I wouldn’t support a policy that didn’t enable people to get around by cars at all, because some people need a car. By that same reasoning I don’t support our current paradigm, where we ignore every other mode of transportation except the car. As a foundational principle we need to prioritize the right of all citizens, regardless of ability or ability levels, to have the right to safely and conveniently exist on our streets. The convenience of one mode of transporation should not be prioritized so much that it makes impossible the ability of other people to safely exist on our roads.
  - Finances: Our cities resources and budgets are limited. Transportation infrastructure is a significant portion of our nation’s and city’s budget. We should prioritize modes of transportation that have less initial cost, less costly and less frequent maintenance. We should also prioritize the modes of transportation that lead to healthier outcomes for our citizens with rising health care costs. I believe in markets and small businesses. I believe that if we don’t have enough money to eat because of a suffering economy our lack of a bike lane will fade in significance. We should prioritize modes of transportation that encourage economic growth, support small businesses, and enable our city to thrive financially. 
  - Convenience: We should prioritize convenience as well. Cars can be incredibly convenient, and inconvenient. Cars are akin to a portable, climate controlled living room. The make travel feel luxurious. But they can also make us look like the folk in the Pixar movie WallE. Cars can be convenient for the people in them, but they can make everything terrible for everyone around them. When people say that cities are loud, they often mean cars are loud. We should factor in convenience as one of our foundational principles for making our policies. 

### Our roads are not made for the safety, or convenience of our children.
### We are creating conflict points with our current infrastructure!

They are made almost entirely for cars. How our city is currently designed is 

### The luxury of on street parking should not be prioritized over the safe travel of our children!

### Our roads are not used for their designed purpose!:

I live on Easter Ave in Littleton. The road is just shy of 0.4 miles. With a lane on each side taken for parking this is about 0.8 miles of on street parking as a prioritization. This is the same road that has sidewalks so narrow a parent and their child cannot walk shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalk on the way to school. But we have almost 0.8 miles of space taken up for the storage of private property. 

How many cars on a typical Saturday morning are parked on this road? 15 cars and one utility trailer. There are 4224 feet in 0.8 miles. The average car length is 14.5 feet. They did not priortize walking nor bicycling when creating our street that leads to 3 schools, but they did prioritize making space for the parking of 291 automobiles. This prioritization and demonstration of values does not make sense to me. 

### Solution for lanes

### It’s too expensive and the infrastructure is already built!

This does have merit. It is expensive to retrofit existing infrastructure to add bicycle lanes. These bicycles lanes do require their own type of maintenance, snow removal, and financial resources. But the many NEW DEVELOPMENTS that are going into our city as we speak are much of the status quo. So not only are we not solving this problem for existing infrastructure, we are barely moving the needle on any new projects. It is simply not something that our city is prioritizing or spending much thought on. A budget and our public policies demonstrate our values. In this way we are failing our most vulnerable citizens and failing to make the wonderful city we could enjoy. 

### Weather!

Many people say “but it snows here!” This isn’t a legitimate reason to not prioritize the sharing of our limited road space with pedestrians and  bicycles. The feeling of being safe and having infrastructure that makes riding bikes and walking convenient are far more deterministic that the presence of adverse weather or hills. Oulu in Finland is a great example of this dynamic. It’s a city in the arctic circle where the majority of children ride their bikes to school even when the pathways are permanently covered in snow. 

### A solution - we focus first on our education corridor and new developments

It is costly to retrofit old infrastructure. We should start by focusing on two areas. All new developments should follow principles of prioritization that prioritize the modes of transportation that are the most safe, least costly, most accessible and protect our cities finances. We should start with retrofits in our educational corridor in Old Littleton. Elati, Windermere, Ridge Road, Caley, Easter Ave and Fremont, and a few other roads should get a retrofit to enable children to get to school on bicycles and by walking. Putting an emphasis on educational corridors and new developments will demonstrate that our city is prioritizing our safety and preserving our resources. 

### We should enshrine how we make these decisions in city policy

Going back to the earlier point about prioritization, we should enshrine these foundational principles, and the policies that stem from them, as a part of city code and policy. At a city meeting a bicycle lane was discussed crossing Santa Fe at the end of Prince. Part of the reason for possibly not adding a bicycle lane was the lack of infrastructure to remove snow from the bicycle lanes. The question about a bicycle lane was something that people were discussing informally. We shouldn't leave these decisions to the whims of the currently elected officials. Decisions like this should be made based on foundational principles on how to prioritize competing needs, and used consistently for every piece of road we build, fix, or maintain moving forward.

### Closing

Our great city can be even better. It can be WONDERFUL. It can have design principles at its foundation that make our city safe for our most vulnerable citizens. It can be a place that encourages children to get off the seat and use their body for exercise. Where getting in exercise isn’t an activity that you drive to the gym to participate in, it can be a normal part of your day to day because of infrastructure that supports it, improving our health outcomes for our citizens. It can be a city that doesn’t make losing your license as you age a complete reduction in your freedom to navigate our roads. It can provide the opportunity for our oldest citizens to age in place. Littleton, and your city if you are not in Littleton, can be a place where our disabled fellow citizens do not only have one safe option to travel in the car, but have multiple modes of transportation that are safe and convenient. Our cities can be WONDERFUL. And by making space for people at various levels of ability, financial resources, age, and preference we make a better city for everyone. This may mean that instead of our cities being entirely optimized for the car we must have some compromises. But this is the right thing for us to do!
