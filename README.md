# open-streets-for-all

Defining principles and policies that will lead to a better city for our residents with diverse goals and diverse needs. The goal of this repository is to have cities have these guardrails on building out their infrastructure so all can benefit. A city that builds mobility for all has less cost and a more vibrant economy (TODO: some type of citation would be helpful here). 

Can we come up with a list of principles and policies that lead to great outcomes? 


### Organization

The documents are organized in two documents:

  - `Policies`: Where we outline what policies, in practice, we have on the books of the town that govern how we maintain, improve, or build our city's infrastructure. 
  - `Principles`: The principles we use that inform the policies that are created. These principles should lead to great policies. The policies should lead to great outcomes for our city. If our principles, and our policies, are not creating a more livable, economically vibrant city then we should update our principles.
