# Principles

### Guiding principles

These guiding principles are the foundational layer of how we think about streets and our public infrastructure. If these principles fail to bring about a good outcome they should be improved. 

- **Access for all:** Our public infrastructure, and especially our streets, should enable people with a variety of needs to safely and conveniently travel throughout out city. 
- **Prioritizing mobility:** How do we prioritize which modes of transportation get priority? Priority in building infrastructure should go towards the modalities that:
  - Use the least resources from a consumption, space, and CO2 perspective
  - Pollute the least
  - Are safe and cause the fewest deaths and injuries
  - Make small scale businesses and economic activity viable (has a lot to do with zoning)
  - Create public space that is livable
  - Is desired by the community and practical 
  - Is maintainable at low cost
- **Cost effective:** A large factor of how we build out our built environment is the cost of the infrastructure. 
- **No right to speed:** Nobody should feel entitled to travel through any neighborhood or area of our town quickly. There is no guarantee of speed. As a resident of my town I do not have the right to demand infrastructure in another town to travel through their town quickly. Their right to have a safe, livable, environment in their town is prioritized higher than my desire to travel through their town quickly. Nobody has a right to speed.
